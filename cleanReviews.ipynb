It is lighter.Good performance ~ Very smoothGood battery life ~ I charged it 100% at 3 PM now after lazy use it is at 61% at 10.30 PM and Next day till 3.33 PM it is at 18%, which is quite good.Also 5G works good, in my XR there were hardly any networks but it‚Äôs antenna is really good. 5G works like a charm.Cons :Heating was there in 16.0.x but fixed in 17.0.1, in 16.0.x it heats up around cam area at the top mainly.Now after the fix,It heated up in 30-40% charging, then heated up again in 70%, at 80% it is cool, and at 100% it was cool. Which is normal, trust me all iPhones heats up, even my XR heats up but is not observable because of the phone cover.Battery took around 2 hours to charge(my battery was at 6% I put up on charging around 1 PM and at 2.45 or 3 PM it was around 100% now I have set the limit to 80% for good battery life)Later at around 100% battery when I used basic app, it heats up a little around cam area but the heat is very minor. Since I am not using any cover so I felt it.Overall after the fix, the heating is resolved completely, so you can be assured in this area.Battery backup is quite good, I am using 80% optimised battery option and y‚Äôday night I charged it and today till 8.26 PM it is at 27%, I watched video, shopping apps, social media apps heavily.It keeps a check of your battery charging cycle, since I‚Äôm using 80% Limit, the charging has fasten up, it usually takes 35-40 min for 80% and then after it slows down the charging.Durability : I have checked few reviews, the back panel is weak it has high chances of breaking, the front glass is strong but could get scratches.USE COVERS AND TEMPERED. Overall for apple users, it is a beast in performance. Do not panic if this gets heats up, it is an APP and OS issue.I‚Äôm observing the apps and OS and the heating area but it is doing brilliant so far.Cam Quality : I am not liking the front camera pictures, it actually overdo the image, you might not like Selfies but there are plenty of options for video and camera. You can shoot in 4K and Raw max, etc.I‚Äôm not a selfie lover so it is kinda okay for me but you will def not like the after camera processing selfie image.Sound Quality: The best, superior DOLBY sound quality. I haven‚Äôt heard this much of brilliant sound in any of the devices in recent times. Decent sound..!! You will love the music and AV.FYI : It fell down from a meter height but since I had a good case so nothing happened luckily. pls make sure you have a good cover. I saw videos the back panel is weak due to different assembly in this series.PS : I‚Äôm not a heavy user. I don't play games, so cannot review on the heat and battery while playing games. \",\n",

The optimized hardware and software integration ensure efficient power management, allowing you to stay connected and productive throughout the day. With support for fast charging and wireless charging, recharging is faster and more convenient than ever.Negative Points:1. Premium Price Tag:As with previous iPhone models, the iPhone 15 Pro Max comes with a premium price tag that may be prohibitive for some consumers.

While the improvements in performance, camera technology, and battery life are notable, they may not be significant enough to justify upgrading for some users.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is a remarkable smartphone that pushes the boundaries of innovation and performance. With its revolutionary design, stunning display, exceptional performance, revolutionary camera system, and enhanced battery life, it offers a truly immersive mobile experience. While it may have some drawbacks such as its premium price tag, lack of major design changes, dependency on ecosystem, and incremental upgrades, its overall strengths far outweigh its weaknesses.

The phone has 6 GB of RAM and comes in three storage options: 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB.The iPhone 15 pro max runs on iOS 15, which is the latest version of Apple's operating system. iOS 15 offers many new features and improvements, such as widgets, app library, picture-in-picture, app clips, and more. iOS 15 also enhances the privacy and security of the phone, with features like app tracking transparency, sign in with Apple, and Face ID.ConclusionThe iPhone 15 pro max is a premium and powerful smartphone, that offers a great user experience. The phone has a beautiful design and display, a superb camera and battery, and a blazing-fast performance and software.

       " \" Packing is bad. There's a tampered package within a new package. The tampered package contained the phone. But the phone is looking good \",\n",
       " \" I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling. \",\n",

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it works extremely well and I am completely satisfied with it. but, it is way too expensive for a phone.

For moderate use of Social media, whatsapp, youtube, audible (audio books), music while exercising, Battery life is around 2 days or sometimes more than 2 days. If you are a gamer or use mobile a lot you might need to charge your mobile everyday.Camera is good. So far the pictures I took the quality is good.Not explore the processor's capacity yet but Never hanged or never will for me (not a heavy user so won't be a problem).\n","28":"\n15 pro max >>>> all androids .  the speed the camera the new ios justtt superbthe resident evil village runs so smoothly\n","29":"\nI recently switched from android to iphone.

Totally worth the upgrade because of the camera.\n","39":"\nIf you already have 14 Pro or Pro Max then don't upgrade, but if you've any other Pro or non Pro models go for it. If you need an iPhone with 24-26hr battery life on a single charge then go for Pro Max models. No doubt Apple's 4K 60fps ProRes is really awesome, and the all new type-c port is the best thing Apple has done in years. Also all the type-c cables included in the box are woven design, now expecting this will not turn grey after few months of use.\n","40":"\nThe phone is really good it had some overheating issue as heard but not faced any it was due to software update now it is all fixed I still did not had any issue regarding overheating.

It is lighter.Good performance ~ Very smoothGood battery life ~ I charged it 100% at 3 PM now after lazy use it is at 61% at 10.30 PM and Next day till 3.33 PM it is at 18%, which is quite good.Also 5G works good, in my XR there were hardly any networks but it\u2019s antenna is really good. 5G works like a charm.Cons :Heating was there in 16.0.x but fixed in 17.0.1, in 16.0.x it heats up around cam area at the top mainly.Now after the fix,It heated up in 30-40% charging, then heated up again in 70%, at 80% it is cool, and at 100% it was cool. Which is normal, trust me all iPhones heats up, even my XR heats up but is not observable because of the phone cover.Battery took around 2 hours to charge(my battery was at 6% I put up on charging around 1 PM and at 2.45 or 3 PM it was around 100% now I have set the limit to 80% for good battery life)Later at around 100% battery when I used basic app, it heats up a little around cam area but the heat is very minor. Since I am not using any cover so I felt it.Overall after the fix, the heating is resolved completely, so you can be assured in this area.Battery backup is quite good, I am using 80% optimised battery option and y\u2019day night I charged it and today till 8.26 PM it is at 27%, I watched video, shopping apps, social media apps heavily.It keeps a check of your battery charging cycle, since I\u2019m using 80% Limit, the charging has fasten up, it usually takes 35-40 min for 80% and then after it slows down the charging.Durability : I have checked few reviews, the back panel is weak it has high chances of breaking, the front glass is strong but could get scratches.USE COVERS AND TEMPERED. Overall for apple users, it is a beast in performance. Do not panic if this gets heats up, it is an APP and OS issue.I\u2019m observing the apps and OS and the heating area but it is doing brilliant so far.Cam Quality : I am not liking the front camera pictures, it actually overdo the image, you might not like Selfies but there are plenty of options for video and camera. You can shoot in 4K and Raw max, etc.I\u2019m not a selfie lover so it is kinda okay for me but you will def not like the after camera processing selfie image.Sound Quality: The best, superior DOLBY sound quality. I haven\u2019t heard this much of brilliant sound in any of the devices in recent times. Decent sound..!! You will love the music and AV.FYI : It fell down from a meter height but since I had a good case so nothing happened luckily. pls make sure you have a good cover. I saw videos the back panel is weak due to different assembly in this series.PS : I\u2019m not a heavy user. I don't play games, so cannot review on the heat and battery while playing games.\n","51":"\nBest performance smartphoneValue for moneyVery light phoneNo heating issuesBest phone if no budget problem for sure\n","52":"\nBattery 10\/10Cemra 10\/10Performance 10\/10Disign 10\/10Display 10\/10Agar pese hai to isse Badiya phone nahi hai market ne Phil haal\n","53":"\nWhen you hold this phone in your hand then only you can realise feeling of holding a premium phone \ud83c\udf4e\n","54":"\nI have purchased natural titanium and it's really awesome.

I have been using it for a month now, and here are my thoughts on it.Design and DisplayThe iPhone 15 pro max has a sleek and elegant design, with a stainless steel frame and a ceramic shield glass back.

The tampered package contained the phone. But the phone is looking good\n","73":"\nI recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling.\n","74":"\nCamera quality is best\n","75":"\nGood product\n","76":"\nHeating Issue during Charging & Required AC room for Charging otherwise charging will stop due to mobile heating \/ high temperature which is a major issue in Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.I suggest avoiding it, especially in the summer, if you don't have an AC room.This is my personal experience!!\n","77":"\nGood mobile but Too much price.

And when I used the phone earlier, the device gets too warm easily when I started to play games...and I contacted the Amazon and iOS support and told me to visit the service centre and the service centre is like 1-2 days far from my home location.

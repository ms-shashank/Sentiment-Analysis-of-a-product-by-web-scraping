I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point.

Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.\n","72":"\nNo Backlit!

I found new laptop response is very quick for same software rendering.My friend using this laptop mostly for office work Mostly like Excel work - Multiple files at a time for Data analysis, PPT, Emailing, some analytical softwares and Browsing prupose.Pros -Very good Battery life 8+hrs for work on internet and videos with mid volume.screen view experience is good.very light and portableworks fine with 6-10  Excel files at at a time no lag till now.movie experience is good6 cores processorDDR4 2666Mhz Ram with 2 ports.(Easy to Upgrade up to 16GB)Dell Comfort view screen feature to view screen long time(Less Harmful blue light).Cons -No Keyboard Backlit in the New era.No optical drive (Not needed nowadays - But mentioned in the product specification need to update it)No additional SSD or HDD port for upgrade.\n","81":"\nGood processing and sleek design easy to carry\n","82":"\nI like the laptop performance, but the heating issue is a concern to be dealt with.\n","83":"\nI purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usage\n","84":"\nThe laptop has a heating issue, and the screen display is not satisfactory.

Immediately, contacted Dell support through chat and they guided me to do some diagnostic tests and said there is nothing wrong with the laptop. When I asked, 'Why the laptop is burning hot?' there is no answer. When I requested to send a technician, they denied and asked me to take the laptop to the service center. I did not buy new laptop to waste my time to take it to the service center. Now the laptop screen freezes. It does not boot sometimes and hence I have to push power button for 20 seconds in order to boot. Also, while booting, it often takes to recovery screen saying, \"Windows did not shut down properly' or 'Windows did not load properly'. Instead of using chat support service, I called customer service last week over phone and they said they would send a technician. I am hoping the technician is able to identify the issue and fix it.\n","163":"\nWhen i was planning to buy laptop. Everyone suggested that i should buy Dell Vostro.

No keyboard backlight either. Coming to the display and graphics, really pathetic quality. Even after adjusting it, the display and graphics are so bad.

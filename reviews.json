Yes the Camera is not what you would expect in high end devices but that is a given because of the price point. I bought it as a future backup for an iPhone but I might just use this for a while before switching again. Speed is really good, as good as my S20fe 5g that I have been using and I have no complains on that. The battery backup is good even with hotspot running and the charging speed is good too. It has a stock Android experience as cheery on top and the animations they did add are good. Also - the fingerprint reader on the power button is much faster than underscreen optical scanners.\n","9":"\nWorth spending amount and got a good price Value for the Spent on item.\n","10":"\nCamera quality (108) is really nice and is very smooth to use..

The 128GB storage capacity is sufficient for my needs, holding plenty of apps, photos, and videos without the need for constant cleanup.One aspect I appreciate is the design - the Pastel Lime color gives it a unique look that stands out. The build quality feels solid, yet the phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold.The display quality is commendable with good color reproduction and brightness levels, making it suitable for various lighting conditions. Battery life is another plus point; it easily lasts through a day of moderate to heavy usage, thanks to its efficient power management.Camera performance is decent for the price, capturing good quality photos in well-lit conditions. The wide and macro lenses offer versatility in photography, though low-light performance could be improved.Overall, the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a well-rounded smartphone that offers good value for its tech specifications and performance.\n","73":"\nSimply Great\n","74":"\nBest phone under 20k and fast delivery by Amazon camera is very good and battery backup is good good phone for gaming\n","75":"\nGood product\n","76":"\nAmazing battery life, a good screen.

Touch sensitivity is also fine.\n","105":"\nOk but mobile getting heated when charged ,when used.\n","106":"\nAfter using the phone for a year, I've had a generally positive experience. It's been reliable with no major issues, but the battery life leaves much to be desired. The camera performs adequately, capturing decent quality photos and videos. However, it struggles in low-light conditions. Overall, the phone's durability and performance are satisfactory for daily use, but improvements in battery life and camera capabilities would greatly enhance the user experience. If you prioritize longevity and basic functionality over advanced camera features, this phone could still be a suitable choice.\n","107":"\nGood\n","108":"\nThe OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a decent mid-range phone that offers good value for casual users. Here's a breakdown of my experience:**Pros:*** **Smooth Display:** The 6.72-inch 120Hz display is great for everyday use. Scrolling and watching videos feels fluid.* **Decent Camera:** The 108MP main camera takes good photos in daylight, capturing accurate colors and details.* **Lasting Battery:** The 5,000mAh battery easily lasts a full day on a single charge. Plus, 67W fast charging is a big plus.* **Clean Software:** OxygenOS is user-friendly and bloatware-free, offering a smooth Android experience.**Cons:*** **Limited Performance:** The Snapdragon 695 SoC can handle basic tasks well, but struggles with multitasking or demanding games.* **Storage Issues:** While 8GB of RAM is decent, the phone stutters if you install too many apps. Lite users won't face this, but power users might.* **Average Cameras:** The macro and depth sensors are just fillers, and low-light performance is strictly average.**Overall:**The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a good choice for homemakers, social media enthusiasts, or anyone who prioritizes battery life and a clean interface over top-of-the-line performance. However, if you're a gamer or someone who juggles many apps, the limited storage and performance might be a concern.\n","109":"\nOsm mobile phone\n","110":"\nWhile talking in speaker mode, voice is too low to hear while media speaker is also low but doesn't have the issue.Overall it's good except above for me\n","111":"\nVery Good product\ud83d\udc4d\n","112":"\nLike prodectt cost\n","113":"\nVery good news\n","114":"\n\u0920\u0940\u0915 \u0920\u093e\u0915\n","115":"\nCamera not good but phone was nice\n","116":"\nGood\n","117":"\nIt's cost effective and easy to use.

Take photos and videos like a professional,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
The iPhone 15 Pro Max is a very versatile phone with professional cameras having 4 options of optical lenses of 0.5x, 1x, 2x and 5x and a macro lens option. It is better and more cost effective than having an SLR camera with many lens options, which you need to acquire. The charge lasts long enough for my filming videos of YouTube channel. Superb

Just amazing!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Just amazing product. Actually I like to purchase online products but as it's so expensive, I tried to purchase from local store in Barasat but they told me 8 thousand more than online price (Only phone's price)😀 even without charger, screen protector and back cover.I got it on online with everything only ₹1,52,000. Although it was a little difficult to buy, as you know it is not easy to transfer the higher amounts within short time. 😀However, Thanks to Amazon team and specially thanks to my IDOL ""Steve Jobs"" 🙏🤗

Beast!!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
I would prefer this over S24 ultra. Used both phones and impressed by this phone. Yes I agree s24 ultra had few more features but in terms of quality 15 pro max wins. And camera quality is far better than s24ultra. But it differs on a customer’s choice.

Hot Stuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
This Phone is like the Central processing unit (CPU) with a screen. It is fast as thunder and got heated like lava after using it for sometime. Camera is better than reflection of mirror and it's screen and overall body is weaker than a mirror i.e. it breaks easily.

The best phone to show that you are doing great,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
A phone that screams that you are doing very well for yourself. Don’t get me wrong, it works extremely well and I am completely satisfied with it. but, it is way too expensive for a phone. I have a pixel 8 which as a secondary phone which costs way less and I am satisfied with that as well. Nevertheless, nothing can replace an iPhone for me due to personal preferences
"
Real Pro phone,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
A17 Pro , 3Nm ,Ray tracing , 5x zoom nailed it completely. A truly freaking flagship mobile so far. iOs 18 will make it more powerful.

Good Mobile (If you have budget go for it. don't buy to impress or on EMI (not worth it)),5.0 out of 5 stars,"
As I was aware that what I need and what I was paying for, I needed a quality mobile with best hardware and software combination.I need the OS to be clean without any bloatware which I got.I don't play games. For moderate use of Social media, whatsapp, youtube, audible (audio books), music while exercising, Battery life is around 2 days or sometimes more than 2 days. If you are a gamer or use mobile a lot you might need to charge your mobile everyday.Camera is good. So far the pictures I took the quality is good.Not explore the processor's capacity yet but Never hanged or never will for me (not a heavy user so won't be a problem).

"Worth every penny, awesome battery life",5.0 out of 5 stars,"
If you already have 14 Pro or Pro Max then don't upgrade, but if you've any other Pro or non Pro models go for it. If you need an iPhone with 24-26hr battery life on a single charge then go for Pro Max models. No doubt Apple's 4K 60fps ProRes is really awesome, and the all new type-c port is the best thing Apple has done in years. Also all the type-c cables included in the box are woven design, now expecting this will not turn grey after few months of use.

Beast Gadget with PROS CONS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
Pros :Light weighted ~ My XR weighted more than pro max. It is lighter.Good performance ~ Very smoothGood battery life ~ I charged it 100% at 3 PM now after lazy use it is at 61% at 10.30 PM and Next day till 3.33 PM it is at 18%, which is quite good.Also 5G works good, in my XR there were hardly any networks but it’s antenna is really good. 5G works like a charm.Cons :Heating was there in 16.0.x but fixed in 17.0.1, in 16.0.x it heats up around cam area at the top mainly.Now after the fix,It heated up in 30-40% charging, then heated up again in 70%, at 80% it is cool, and at 100% it was cool. Which is normal, trust me all iPhones heats up, even my XR heats up but is not observable because of the phone cover.Battery took around 2 hours to charge(my battery was at 6% I put up on charging around 1 PM and at 2.45 or 3 PM it was around 100% now I have set the limit to 80% for good battery life)Later at around 100% battery when I used basic app, it heats up a little around cam area but the heat is very minor. Since I am not using any cover so I felt it.Overall after the fix, the heating is resolved completely, so you can be assured in this area.Battery backup is quite good, I am using 80% optimised battery option and y’day night I charged it and today till 8.26 PM it is at 27%, I watched video, shopping apps, social media apps heavily.It keeps a check of your battery charging cycle, since I’m using 80% Limit, the charging has fasten up, it usually takes 35-40 min for 80% and then after it slows down the charging.Durability : I have checked few reviews, the back panel is weak it has high chances of breaking, the front glass is strong but could get scratches.USE COVERS AND TEMPERED. Overall for apple users, it is a beast in performance. Do not panic if this gets heats up, it is an APP and OS issue.I’m observing the apps and OS and the heating area but it is doing brilliant so far.Cam Quality : I am not liking the front camera pictures, it actually overdo the image, you might not like Selfies but there are plenty of options for video and camera. You can shoot in 4K and Raw max, etc.I’m not a selfie lover so it is kinda okay for me but you will def not like the after camera processing selfie image.Sound Quality: The best, superior DOLBY sound quality. I haven’t heard this much of brilliant sound in any of the devices in recent times. Decent sound..!! You will love the music and AV.FYI : It fell down from a meter height but since I had a good case so nothing happened luckily. pls make sure you have a good cover. I saw videos the back panel is weak due to different assembly in this series.PS : I’m not a heavy user. I don't play games, so cannot review on the heat and battery while playing games.

We have received the iPhone 15 Pro Max, natural titanium color, and 256 GB storage capacity. The phone is good-looking and fast.

Unleash the Future with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
In the fast-paced world of smartphones, Apple continues to set the bar high with each new iteration of their iconic iPhone lineup. The iPhone 15 Pro Max is no exception, boasting cutting-edge technology, stunning design, and a plethora of features that promise to elevate your mobile experience to new heights. In this comprehensive review, we'll delve into the positive aspects as well as the potential drawbacks of Apple's latest flagship device.Positive Points:1. Revolutionary Design:The iPhone 15 Pro Max features a sleek and sophisticated design that pushes the boundaries of smartphone aesthetics. With its edge-to-edge display, premium materials, and refined finish, it exudes elegance and craftsmanship. The slim profile and ergonomic curves make it comfortable to hold, while the durable construction ensures longevity.2. Stunning Display:At the heart of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is its mesmerizing display, which sets new standards for clarity, brightness, and color accuracy. The ProMotion OLED panel delivers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and HDR content support for an immersive viewing experience. Whether you're browsing the web, watching movies, or playing games, every detail comes to life with stunning realism.3. Exceptional Performance:Powered by Apple's latest A-series chip, the iPhone 15 Pro Max offers unparalleled performance and efficiency. From multitasking to gaming, every task is handled with lightning speed and responsiveness. The advanced neural engine enhances machine learning capabilities, enabling intelligent features like enhanced photography and augmented reality experiences.4. Revolutionary Camera System:The iPhone 15 Pro Max boasts a revolutionary camera system that redefines smartphone photography. With advanced computational photography features, including improved Night mode, Deep Fusion, and Smart HDR, every shot is optimized for clarity and detail. The ProRAW and ProRes video recording capabilities offer professional-grade flexibility and control, allowing users to unleash their creativity.5. Enhanced Battery Life:Despite its powerful performance and advanced features, the iPhone 15 Pro Max delivers impressive battery life that keeps up with your busy lifestyle. The optimized hardware and software integration ensure efficient power management, allowing you to stay connected and productive throughout the day. With support for fast charging and wireless charging, recharging is faster and more convenient than ever.Negative Points:1. Premium Price Tag:As with previous iPhone models, the iPhone 15 Pro Max comes with a premium price tag that may be prohibitive for some consumers. While the investment is justified by its advanced features and performance, it may not be accessible to budget-conscious buyers.2. Lack of Major Design Changes:While the iPhone 15 Pro Max boasts an impressive design, some critics may argue that it lacks major design changes compared to its predecessors. The overall form factor remains largely unchanged, leading to criticisms of stagnation in design innovation.3. Dependency on Ecosystem:The iPhone 15 Pro Max is part of Apple's ecosystem, which offers seamless integration with other Apple devices and services. While this can be a positive aspect for existing Apple users, it may pose challenges for users who prefer a more open ecosystem or who are heavily invested in competing platforms.4. Incremental Upgrades:Despite its status as a flagship device, some users may perceive the iPhone 15 Pro Max as offering only incremental upgrades over previous models. While the improvements in performance, camera technology, and battery life are notable, they may not be significant enough to justify upgrading for some users.Conclusion:In conclusion, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is a remarkable smartphone that pushes the boundaries of innovation and performance. With its revolutionary design, stunning display, exceptional performance, revolutionary camera system, and enhanced battery life, it offers a truly immersive mobile experience. While it may have some drawbacks such as its premium price tag, lack of major design changes, dependency on ecosystem, and incremental upgrades, its overall strengths far outweigh its weaknesses. Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a professional photographer, or simply someone who demands the best from their smartphone, the iPhone 15 Pro Max delivers in spades.

A High end phone for heavy tasks and security.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
The iPhone 15 pro max is the latest flagship smartphone from Apple, and it offers some impressive features and performance. I have been using it for a month now, and here are my thoughts on it.Design and DisplayThe iPhone 15 pro max has a sleek and elegant design, with a stainless steel frame and a ceramic shield glass back. It is available in four colors: silver, graphite, gold, and pacific blue. The phone is water and dust resistant, and it supports wireless charging and MagSafe accessories.The display is a 6.7-inch OLED screen, with a resolution of 2778 x 1284 pixels and a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The screen is bright, sharp, and smooth, and it supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision. The notch at the top houses the Face ID sensor and the 12 MP selfie camera.Camera and BatteryThe iPhone 15 pro max has a triple rear camera system, consisting of a 12 MP wide-angle lens, a 12 MP telephoto lens, and a 12 MP ultra-wide-angle lens. The camera can capture stunning photos and videos, with optical image stabilization, 5x optical zoom, night mode, portrait mode, and 4K video recording at 60 fps. The camera also supports LiDAR scanning, which enables faster autofocus and better depth sensing.The battery life of the iPhone 15 pro max is excellent, as it can last for a whole day of heavy usage. The phone supports fast charging, and it can reach 50% charge in 30 minutes with a 20W adapter. The phone also supports wireless charging and MagSafe charging, which can deliver up to 15W of power.Performance and SoftwareThe iPhone 15 pro max is powered by the A15 Bionic chip, which is the most advanced processor in the market. The chip has a six-core CPU, a five-core GPU, and a 16-core neural engine. The phone can handle any task or app with ease, and it delivers smooth and fast performance. The phone has 6 GB of RAM and comes in three storage options: 128 GB, 256 GB, and 512 GB.The iPhone 15 pro max runs on iOS 15, which is the latest version of Apple's operating system. iOS 15 offers many new features and improvements, such as widgets, app library, picture-in-picture, app clips, and more. iOS 15 also enhances the privacy and security of the phone, with features like app tracking transparency, sign in with Apple, and Face ID.ConclusionThe iPhone 15 pro max is a premium and powerful smartphone, that offers a great user experience. The phone has a beautiful design and display, a superb camera and battery, and a blazing-fast performance and software.

Packing is bad,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
Packing is bad. There's a tampered package within a new package. The tampered package contained the phone. But the phone is looking good
"
Incremental Upgrade with Enhanced Camera,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling.

Not satisfied with iPhone 15 Pro Max,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
""I spent 152,000 rupees on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it doesn't seem worth more than a 10,000 rupee phone. I've encountered software issues, with many apps and games not performing well. There are problems with phone calls—calls drop frequently, requiring me to restart the phone each time. Initially, I thought it might be due to other apps or network providers, but I used to use an Android phone with the same network and common apps, and they performed much better. This iPhone keeps crashing apps and games, which, in my opinion, makes it not worth the price.""

Recently, I updated to the latest version of 17.5.1 added emojis something like that and after that my device touch screen isn't responding now. And when I used the phone earlier, the device gets too warm easily when I started to play games...and I contacted the Amazon and iOS support and told me to visit the service centre and the service centre is like 1-2 days far from my home location. This isn't something I expected. The phone is very expensive and I bought recently, just in 1-2 months the device isn't usable, it need to be trash now smh...The device isn't even charging now..

Screen got scratched,1.0 out of 5 stars,"




                    The media could not be loaded.
                



Didn't use a screen guard for a week and found a scratch on the screen. What a stupid phone. 160k phone and you will get a scratch without even holding the phone. Better get a screen guard the day you receive the phone.

Not worth it,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

Brand is brand! Always prefer brand!,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
As a first-time laptop user, the Dell 15 has exceeded my expectations with its excellent performance and versatile features. I primarily use this laptop for trading, watching movies, and general productivity tasks, and it has proven to be more than capable for all my needs.**Performance and Display:**Equipped with an Intel 12th Gen Core i3 processor and 8GB of DDR4 RAM, the laptop delivers smooth and responsive performance, even when multitasking between multiple applications. The 15.6-inch Full HD display with a 120Hz refresh rate provides a stunning visual experience, making movies come to life and enhancing the fluidity of my trading charts.**Portability and Build Quality:**Weighing just 1.69kg and featuring a thin and lightweight design, the Dell 15 is easy to carry around, whether I'm working from home or on the go. The spill-resistant keyboard adds a layer of durability, giving me peace of mind against accidental spills during long trading sessions or movie marathons.**Value for Money:**At a price of 29k, this laptop offers exceptional value for money. With its solid performance, vibrant display, and practical features, it competes favorably with higher-priced alternatives on the market. For a first-time laptop buyer like myself, it's reassuring to know that I've made a wise investment in a reliable and versatile computing device.**Future Updates:**I plan to update this review after six months of using the Dell 15, providing valuable insights into its long-term performance, durability, and any additional features or drawbacks I may discover over time. This will be helpful for others who are considering purchasing the same laptop and are looking for real-world experiences.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, the Dell 15 has been an outstanding first laptop for me. Its combination of performance, display quality, portability, and affordability makes it an ideal choice for users looking for a versatile companion for everyday computing tasks. Whether you're a student, professional, or casual user, the Dell 15 delivers a compelling user experience that punches above its price point. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for their first laptop or a reliable upgrade.

SATISFIED,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
light weight, good portability, decent looks , good built quality, battery lasts 5-6 hrs for normal use , lasts 8 hrs on battery saver mode if you do light works .  All well except one  issue that is it starts lagging /stuttering, videos get hung if you use the laptop while charging due to overheating . But this problem is solved by using better cooling solution like using laptop bottom riser while charging. Dont forget to buy a laptop riser along with this product.

Good laptopn but no USB C port,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
The photo in display and the video shows the laptop to have a USB C port. The product that i received only has the USB 2 ports...NO USB C port (could be just an oversight or error by the seller). It's just a day since it arrived, no complaints as such yet. Looks like a laptop worth it's money.

ONE OF THE BEST LAPTOP FOR STANDARD BUSINESS & HOME USE,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
laptop Performance is Ok , especially availability of genuine windows and MS office Home edition along with bunch of other software preloaded. only you have to partition the SSD into local drives at your end to keep Program files in C drive . Otherwise it is Fast , better performance in 12th generation i3 processor from 11th generation i5.Heating issue is there in all dell laptops including this one, so i will wait for next 2-3 months to check whether this heating issue creates any problem in performance of laptop in summers.Dell shall arrange to direct blowers not towards the screen as in present case , in my opinion the the heat coming from blowers towards the screen may reduce or impact Screen due to heat blow. Laptop also heats from below , so i don't think it is advisable to keep it on lap ( legs) , better to operate on table or some platform.

My experience,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
I like the laptop performance, but the heating issue is a concern to be dealt with.
"
Laptop is good for the price,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
I purchased this laptop on the 18th and today is the 24th. I have read a lot of reviews complaining about heating issues and yes they are right. This laptop is a heater. It will be very helpful during the winter season.But I am keeping this as I have liked it and that's why the good 3 stars I am giving.When you use any laptop for the first few days, it heats up pretty badly because of a lot of updates going on in the background. I was almost scared when I see it heats up super bad and was thinking to return it. But that was just one time. But still, it heats up more than a normal laptop should. I didn't expect it because it is an i3 12th gen and has an underpowered processor.If you want to use this laptop, you will need a laptop cooler and it will be ok.Why I am not returning it?I like it, it looks very beautiful and light and has a nice display and it can handle my coding work. I just purchased it as a backup laptop because my main laptop Asus Vivobook runs 14 to 18hrs a day for the last 5 yrs and it needs some rest.Personally, I won't recommend this laptop. Maybe try Asus or HP. Asus gives the same features with a crap display and powerful i3 processor at a cheaper price.Here in short :-PROS -1) Compact and lightweight2) Good Display and sound3) Doesn't hang. Actually, it will depend on you. I will need to increase RAM to 16gb because I have heavy software and it this i3 can handle it, just need more ram. For Personal usage, it is great.CONS -1) Heating Issues like everyone mentioned. I am just not returning it as it is ok for me.2) Severe Touchpad Issue.EDIT - 14th May, 2023Severe Touchpad Issue. Many times I am clicking touchpad which should trigger left click like all laptops do but sometimes it acts weird and trigger right click. Then it becomes worst and then touchpad stops working. It has happened like 4 times already. It is a brand new laptop and not even 1 month and such a major issue. I reset my laptop. I thought it is because I am using same account of old laptop. In new account on fresh installation, same issue 2 times already. I am disabling this touchpad and using mouse now. I will throw it to the service center in few days.EDIT - 9th July, 20231) Laptop is working fine but touchpad and mouse issue still. I am still using my 6yrs old laptop as my main laptop because its mousepad is fine and better that this laptop. I tested 3 different mouse and it is not smooth but those mouses work fine in old laptop and other laptops too. So something software related issue i guess. I am writing typing from this DELL laptop. I am shutting it down because I cant work fast due to random touchpad issue, will resume work from old laptop. Looks like I have wasted my 40k. May be I will sell this laptop here in Manila, PH and buy some other laptop from here. No more Online laptop now. Next laptop will test fully by using it for 5-10 minutes. Still not recommending this laptop. My coding work is very very light. Even 10 yrs old 2nd generation I3 processor can handle it. So it is not a coding issue.Edit: 31st January, 2024Laptop is working fine for last 3-4 months and no issue now. Specially no touchpad issue. I guess it was software issue. So I am increasing Ratings from 2 to 4 now. Won't still give 5 stars though because of earlier issue. Now this laptop is my main laptop and I use it daily. I bought it as a backup laptop though. Will update after 4-5 months of usage and re-write proper review after 1 year of usage

Blue screen randomly pops up  from the 1st day  and resets the laptop,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
A blue screen randomly pops up and the machine resets immediately. I cannot predict when it will happen again. This has happened couple of times, and I am afraid to loose my college work. Contacted DELL support assist. They were unable to help, and asked to check online at their site.Update 20june2024: Since I received the Laptop on the 16th of June2024, I requested for technical support.They dint come in the scheduled time slot of 2PM to 6PM, called at about 8PM and asked me for the PIN  over the phone, so that they could close the ticket. Since I dint give the pin, they reported that I was not reachable.  Informed Amazon of the same. Amazon informed me to go the DELL's service center to address the issue for the laptop, as its a branded laptop, and is Dells problem.

The speed mentioned is 4.4 GHz whereas the actual speed is 1.3 GHz. I asked for replacement, they said replacement wasn't available, it had to be returned. They did not pickup despite scheduling the pickup up twice. Also, every time the reason mentioned was pickup refused by customer which is totally false. If I was contacted I need proof of the same.I need to travel tomorrow and it will be such a big issue for me now.My work is suffering so much. The customer care people are also not responding. It has been a horrendous experience.

I received a defective laptop.

"Laptop heats up, screen freezes, wouldn't start",1.0 out of 5 stars,"
The day I received this laptop, found out it is heating up too much. Immediately, contacted Dell support through chat and they guided me to do some diagnostic tests and said there is nothing wrong with the laptop. When I asked, 'Why the laptop is burning hot?' there is no answer. When I requested to send a technician, they denied and asked me to take the laptop to the service center. I did not buy new laptop to waste my time to take it to the service center. Now the laptop screen freezes. It does not boot sometimes and hence I have to push power button for 20 seconds in order to boot. Also, while booting, it often takes to recovery screen saying, ""Windows did not shut down properly' or 'Windows did not load properly'. Instead of using chat support service, I called customer service last week over phone and they said they would send a technician. I am hoping the technician is able to identify the issue and fix it.

Worst Performance,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
When i was planning to buy laptop. Everyone suggested that i should buy Dell Vostro. But in my personal opinion Dell is just a Name Nothing more than That. All the Laptops are Same from Within Just a Brand name Differs it. From 1st Day its Lagging and there is no Customer Support. I think People Should Visit all other Brand Stores Before Buying Dell Laptops.You will find that they have Better Urge to Sell and Gave you the Honest Reviews...

Poor graphics and display quality,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
A friend recommended this laptop since the specs are good according to him. I am thoroughly disappointed with this laptop. The look and feel of it is so outdated and hideous. The keyboard keys are so hard and the start button had to be pressed so hard and several times in order to get it to start up!  No keyboard backlight either. Coming to the display and graphics, really pathetic quality. Even after adjusting it, the display and graphics are so bad. Even my phone and tab display quality is 100 times better than this pathetic laptop! I should have just returned it when I had the chance! Total waste of money!

Using it since since one year,but waste product , trust me really waste of your money,especially dell's laptop,  Try to go for another company laptop , but don't ever buy DELL's laptop. After Complaning many times they(DELL company) didn't even tried to help me,BTW instead they asked me to pay more money(more than 10,000) to install some software in Laptop so it may run accurate. Customer support is very worst.  They even didn't try to solve my problem.Trust me Bro/Sis, Plzz don't waste Money.Worst then u will think.

THE BEST PHONE,5.0 out of 5 stars,"
This Phone Is A Game Changer For Me I Was Using A Basic Samsung M13 4G Until One Day I Saw The iPhone 15 Pro Ad And Decided To Purchase It . You Can Definitely Go For This Phone Without Even Thinking , The Camera Is So Nice You Cannot Compare It Against 24 Ultra .You Will Love The Display Because It Has 120HZ Refresh Rate .

Phone needs no review because apple lovers won't even see reviews when it comes to iphones but apple lovers I have a question for you how would you justify the price
"
Worth an upgrade.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
Had upgraded from the Iphone 11 to 15 pro . Many changes and seamless experience but the only issue that exists is the heating issue . The phone heats up while charging , maybe its because of the fast charging but apart from that just browsing Instagram for a certain period heats up the phone. The phone is on the latest update but the issue for heating is yet to be resolved completely. Apart from that everything is flawless especially the camera. Its better if you upgrade from an old Iphone as the experience is flawless.
"
It could be better in battery and camera department,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
iPhones are becoming more competitive every year but this year a new iPhone Pro didn't last a day for me. 13 Pro and 14 Pro were better in battery department. I switched over to 15 Pro Max. Thanks to the less weight due to titanium body. This year Pro Max is the best choice or 15 Plus for budget.

Stunner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
I‚Äôm already in apple ecosystem.I‚Äôd an iPhone 14 which I brought in may.Since I was already on a trip in Thailand, brought this for 98k there.The mere feeling of holding the fastest phone on the planet with the first 3nm chip which can even play PC/PS5 level games is too Damn awesome!
"
Bad battery life,4.0 out of 5 stars,"
Battery life is not good. 14 pro and 14 plus has better battery life. Also, Heating issue is there which is irritating.
"
Not worth it,3.0 out of 5 stars,"
With what we're getting and what we're paying it is not at all worth it. Apple needs to come in terms with the reality. Just paying more for the brand don't work now. The phone Looks mediocre and dull in comparison to pixel and galaxy s24 series.

"Great as always, but not worth the price tag",3.0 out of 5 stars,"
Bought a 15 Pro from Dubai for 90k and it‚Äôs great iPhone for that price. But it‚Äôs extremely overpriced in India. There‚Äôs no way this iPhone is worth 1.3L. Avoid buying it in India or go for a 13-14 (both are great)

Please get a protector for your camera as soon as possible,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
Before using iPhone 15 pro, I used iPhone 12 Pro Max for almost 3 year, in that 3 year period, I accidentally dropped my phone dozens of time but nothing happened to the phone as it should be and as what all of us expect! But after using this new phone iPhone 15 pro for just 2 months, I accidentally dropped it from just waist height, that too on a plane surface, still it lead to break one of my camera glass !So please don‚Äôt trust iPhone or all other YouTubers please do get a iPhone camera protector!

Dont Buy,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
I recently purchased an iPhone 15 pro max 1 TB, but it came with 256 GB if I contacted with Apple store they said that we are not responsible for that. They said pls contact Amazon. Then I contacted Amazon customer service they didn't respond properly. I have been with this phone for 2 months. But yesterday I updated to iOS 17.2 after restarting the mobile display got green and it is under warranty too. I had to go to an Apple service center and explain my problem. They said it has some charges but I can't afford them.  Don't buy apple products service is worst. I got mentally disturbed.. and got thoughts of suicide.....e

Item was delivered with damage. Item not working as well. Very Worst experience. No proper channel to contact for assistance. No valid Apple customer care number available in replacement window. Amazon too cares nothing about this issue despite reaching them umpteen times.

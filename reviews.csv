It's not 5mp macro I feel. Only 2mp. Can I get an exchange,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
I purchased this Redmi note 10 pro only for using 5MP Macro lens. Though the super Macro offer exits pictures are not that good like my other cameras or like the photos taken by my friends using the same model.As I could not upload photos the other way you suggested, I chose to download Amazon app and upload this way.Please allow me to return or allow me to get a better 5 mp macro Redmi note 10 pro please.Thank you

Don't buy go for better brand,1.0 out of 5 stars,"
Worst phone don't go for fake hype created by anyone else.I have bought but it but after i update the front camera stop working.I visited to care they told the phone motherboard will be change at no cost due to company'fault.I have given phone on 30th November 22.It's already a month neither they are repairing neither giving information when it will be ready.everyday i called customer care i mailed to the company but our team will call you back is always the answer.They will harass you & at the end your phone will b just dabba.Think before purchasing
